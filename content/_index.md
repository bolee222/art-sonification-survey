Thank you very much for your interest in our survey.  
The **ultimate goal of our research is to develop an AI music generation method that better expresses '_the sense of dynamics_' that people can percieve from the '_poses of people in the paintings_'**. **This survey** is the first step towards that goal, planned to collect information on how various visual elements of artistic works evoke a sense of movement in the viewer.
