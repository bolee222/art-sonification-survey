This page is a summarized guideline for the Artwork 1 to Artwork 21 survey.  
**Please read it carefully** before completing the survey.



##### (1) The meaning of "Sense of Dynamics" in this survey. 

In this survey, there are recurring questions asking about the **degree of Sense of Dynamics (Movements)** felt when looking at a picture.   

The term Sense of Dynamics in this survey refers to **the attribute indicating movement or vitality, representing the characteristic of a work being active and dynamically perceived rather than static**. 



##### (2) Selecting the Artwork Segments.

This survey includes questions asking "which aspects of the picture influenced your perception of the degree of dynamics." 

The question is *NOT* asking you to express which parts of the image made you feel dynamic. Rather, it asks **which parts of the image influenced the perception of the degree of movement**, including the perception as 'this picture is dynamic' or 'it is not dynamic.' 

When expressing parts of the picture, please mark **based on the divisions of the picture into 16 sections**. Please refer to the diagram guidelines below.
